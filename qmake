If you use qmake to build your projects, Qt GUI is included by default.
To disable Qt GUI, add the following line to your .pro file:
QT -= gui

QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE -= -O2
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE += -Os

Identify all the resources used by your application and add them to one
or more qrc files. Qt Creator updates your qmake project file with the
"RESOURCES" variable listing the qrc files you added.
